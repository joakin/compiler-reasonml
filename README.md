# Compiler test

A test implementation of type inference in Reasonml inspired by
[Type inference for beginners — Part 1 ](https://medium.com/@dhruvrajvanshi/type-inference-for-beginners-part-1-3e0a5be98a4b)

Mostly works, but there are some problems with the implementation, see the end
of `Compiler.re`. Not sure if there is an issue with my implementation or the
article itself.

The objective of this was to learn more about type inference in compilers and to
get some experience with ReasonML.
